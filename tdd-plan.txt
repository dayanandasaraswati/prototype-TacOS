Iteration 1:
-----------
- App is the only class avaiilable now. There are going to be three apps at 
  this point - browser, ide, music. 
- Following basic functionality will be available:
    Browser - visit_webpage(URL)
    IDE     - edit_code(filename)
    Music   - play(music_filename)

  From an user POV, it wouldn't know the type of the app that provides these
  functionalities. All it knows is that it needs an app to do any operation in 
  TacOS.
