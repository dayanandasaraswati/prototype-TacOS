Apps     - Apps are entities that the user interacts with to get something done

Features - Features are distinct functionalities that are used by apps to 
           accomplish user's commands.

Tasks    - A task is a set of operations that when executed  has an 
           user-noticable effect. Tasks are used by features, but features
           do not necessarily use tasks alone.

FeatureSets - A feature-set is a group of features that together accomplish
              a domain-specific activity such as listening to music, watching
              a movie etc. Essentially, a feature-set implements one VERB in 
              the language like listen, watch etc. Apps build feature-sets and 
              publish them in a standard format. One app will be able to pick up
              the feature-set of another app and use it.

Intelligence- The "GOD" system that can predict the right task to execute 
              at a given point in time.
