Prototype design
----------------

1. Applications register a set of action-items/tasks and context elements with 
   TacOS through a configuration file or dynamically by calling APIs.

2. Applications update the values of context elements with TacOS whenever 
   the elements within the application changes.

3. TacOS will have a predefined set of context elements to track system state
   such as battery power, GPS location, WiFi associativity etc. System context
   in addition to app context will be used to train the learning model. 

4. Users will initiate tasks inside App's GUI. Apps will ask TacOS to provide
   a list of action-items to perform to complete the task. Even though 
   the list of action-items for this task was already registered by the app,,
   TacOS will customize this list based on the current context and return it
   to the app. 

5. TacOS will track the actions performed by all aplications because both tasks
   and action-items need to get initiated via TacOS only.


Implementation
--------------
TacOS will run as a separate process and use RPC to communicate with apps. 
It will use SQLite to store tasks and context information. The database wil be
keyed by taskname and app UUID.
